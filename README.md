# FToDo

FToDo is a simple todo list application written in Django. It is a simple project to learn Django. The goal is to create a simple todo list application with the following features:
[x] Add a todo item
[x] Mark a todo item as done
[x] Limit a todo item in a day
[x] List all todo items
[] Delete a todo item
[] Edit a todo item

## Idea

The idea is to create an application to help the user focus on what is important instead of being distracted by the things that are not important. By the end the user can see what they achieved entire day.

## Installation

```bash
git clone
cd ftodo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage

```bash
python manage.py runserver
